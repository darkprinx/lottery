            Title should follow conventional commit format `type(scope): summary`
            - type is one of feat, fix, ref, revert, ci, build, docs, chore
            - scope is optional, it can be a ticket reference or anything else, e.g. feat(CU861naajbt) or build(deps)
            - summary should start with lower case and shouldn't end with punctuation
      - do: description
